I developed this project totally on my own initiative to help students better comprehend sorting algorithms, which many find difficult to understand. The purpose of this project is to make it simpler to understand the operating principles of several algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. 
Input Elements: Start by either generating new elements or manually entering the elements as a comma-separated list.
Choose Sorting Algorithm: Select the type of sorting method you want to use. Options include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
Sort the Elements: Once you've arranged the elements and are satisfied with the speed settings, click the "Sort" button to execute the sorting process.
